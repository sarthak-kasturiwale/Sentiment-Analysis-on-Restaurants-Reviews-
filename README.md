# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Restaurants-Reviews-
- Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages.
- Most of the Restaurants ask reviews to the customers and based on the reviews the restaurant can improve the customer satisfaction. So Reviews plays a vital role for the successful growth of the restaurant.
- In this project, we will try to analyse the sentiments of Reviewers using machine learning which will help in identifying whether a given review is a positive or negative.

# Dataset Description
- The dataset has downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/hj5992/restaurantreviews
- The dataset consists of 1000 rows and 2 columns. Review Column consist of customer reviews and like column consist of 0 and 1. If the review is positive, 1 and if negative, 0.

# Approach for Problem Solving
1. Understanding the Problem
2. Downloading the Dataset
3. Importing necessary Dependencies
4. Exploratory Data Analysis
5. Data Pre-processing
6. Vectorization
7. Building the Model
8. Evaluation of the Model
9. End Results

# End Results
- We evaluated accuracy on on test data whcih is representative of true predictive performance.
- We get the accuracy of about 74.% on unseen data by using Random Forest which is happened to be Best Accuracy till now.
- We have also used LSTMs but the data we have is only 1000 reviews so the LSTMs does not work as expected.
